## What it does

`wayfinder` takes an effort too big for one agent session — wrapped in fog, where the way from here to the goal isn't visible yet — and charts it as a **shared map** of **decision tickets** on your issue tracker, then resolves them one at a time until the way is clear. It **plans, it doesn't do**: every ticket resolves a decision — a question to settle, not a slice of a build to execute — and the map is done when nothing is left to decide before someone goes and builds the thing — so it produces decisions, not deliverables.

## When to reach for it

You invoke this by typing `/wayfinder` — the agent won't reach for it on its own.

Reach for it when an effort is **more than one agent session can hold** and the route to its **destination** is still foggy — you can feel the shape of the work but can't yet write it down as a spec or a plan. For turning an *already-clear* thread into a spec, use [to-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-spec); for slicing an already-understood plan into buildable tickets, use [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets). Wayfinder sits upstream of both: it's what you run when there's too much fog to spec directly.

## Prerequisites

The map and its tickets live on the configured issue tracker. Run
[framework-setup](./framework-setup.md) first and follow its local Markdown,
GitHub Issues, Jira, or Linear adapter. Wayfinder never silently substitutes a
different tracker.

## The map is an index, fog is the frontier

The **map** is a single `wayfinder:map` issue whose tickets are its child issues — one shared URL the whole team can watch. It's an **index, not a store**: each decision lives in exactly one place (its ticket), and the map only gists and links, never restates. A session loads the map at low resolution and zooms into individual tickets on demand.

Beyond the live tickets lies the **fog of war** — decisions you can tell are coming but can't yet pin down. The test for whether something is a ticket or still fog is whether you can *state the question precisely now*, not whether you can answer it. Resolving a ticket clears the fog ahead of it, **graduating** whatever's now specifiable into fresh tickets. The **frontier** is the open, unblocked, unclaimed tickets — the edge of the known — and it's what the tracker's native blocking renders visually, so you see what's takeable without opening the map. Fog only gathers *toward* the **destination**; work past it is ruled **out of scope**, closed, never graduating.

Every ticket is **HITL** (human in the loop — grilling, prototype) or **AFK** (agent alone — research); a HITL ticket only resolves through a live exchange, so the agent never answers its own questions. Research stays a real ticket — a shared blocker downstream decisions hang on — but because it's AFK, a session doesn't stop and read: it fires a `/research` **subagent** to burn the ticket down in parallel, keeping the frontier fast, and captures the findings on a throwaway `research/<name>` branch.

## It's working if

- Naming the **destination** is the first act — before any ticket exists — because it fixes the scope every ticket is measured against.
- One map is one `wayfinder:map` issue; tickets are its child issues, referred to by **name**, never a bare `#42`.
- A session resolves **at most one ticket** (research tickets excepted), records the answer as a resolution comment, closes the ticket, and appends a one-line pointer to *Decisions so far*.
- Durable product intent is refined into the configured SRS while the decision ticket retains its rationale and investigation record.
- If the opening grill surfaces **no fog**, it stops and tells you the journey is small enough to skip the map.

## Where it fits

`wayfinder` is a big-idea **on-ramp**: an effort too large and foggy to spec in
one sitting generates a cleared decision map. When the fog is gone, use
[srs-modeling](./srs-modeling.md) to audit the canonical SRS, then `to-spec`
extracts a feature slice for the main build flow. It leans on `grilling`,
`domain-modeling`, `prototype`, and `research` to resolve individual tickets.
When you're unsure which flow fits, [framework-router](./framework-router.md)
routes you.
